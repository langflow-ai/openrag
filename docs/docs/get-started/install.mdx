OpenRAG can be installed in multiple ways:

* [**Python wheel**](#install-python-wheel): Install the OpenRAG Python wheel and use the [OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui) to install, run, and configure your OpenRAG deployment without running Docker commands.

* [**Docker Compose**](#install-and-run-docker): Clone the OpenRAG repository and deploy OpenRAG with Docker Compose, including all services and dependencies.

## Prerequisites 

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
    - macOS and Linux: Version 3.10 to 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. If using Podman, use [podman-compose](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) or alias Docker compose commands to Podman commands.
- For GPU support: (TBD)

## Docker {#install-and-run-docker}

The OpenRAG Docker Compose file starts five containers:

| Container Name | Default Address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| OpenRAG Backend | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI server and core functionality. |
| OpenRAG Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | React web interface for users. |
| Langflow | http://localhost:7860 | AI workflow engine and flow management. |
| OpenSearch | http://localhost:9200 | Vector database for document storage. |
| OpenSearch Dashboards | http://localhost:5601 | Database administration interface. |

There are two different Docker Compose files.
They deploy the same applications and containers, but to different environments.

- [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) is an OpenRAG deployment with GPU support for accelerated AI processing.

- [`docker-compose-cpu.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose-cpu.yml) is a CPU-only version of OpenRAG for systems without GPU support. Use this Docker compose file for environments where GPU drivers aren't available.

To install OpenRAG with Docker Compose:

1. Clone the OpenRAG repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag.git
   cd openrag
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the repository root.
    ```
    touch .env
    ```

3. Set environment variables. The Docker Compose files are populated with values from your `.env`, so the following values are **required** to be set:

   ```bash
   OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER=admin
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your_langflow_password
   LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```
   For more information on configuring OpenRAG with environment variables, see [Environment variables](configure/environment-variables).
   For additional configuration values, including `config.yaml`, see [Configuration](/configure/configuration).

4. Deploy OpenRAG with Docker Compose based on your deployment type.

   For GPU-enabled systems, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   For CPU-only systems, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yml up -d
   ```

5. Verify installation by confirming all services are running.

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

   You can now access the application at:

   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
   - **Langflow**: http://localhost:7860

Continue with the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Python wheel {#install-python-wheel}

The Python wheel is currently available internally, but will be available on PyPI at launch.
The wheel installs the OpenRAG wheel, which includes the TUI for installing, running, and managing OpenRAG.
For more information on virtual environments, see [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments).

1. Create a new project with a virtual environment using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments).

   ```bash
   uv init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
   cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
   ```
2. Add the OpenRAG wheel to your project and install it in the virtual environment.
   Replace `PATH/TO/` and `VERSION` with your OpenRAG wheel location and version.
   ```bash
   uv add PATH/TO/openrag-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
   ```
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed and updated in your virtual environment.
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. Start the OpenRAG TUI.
   ```bash
   uv run openrag
   ```

    The OpenRAG TUI opens.

5. To install OpenRAG with Basic Setup, click **Basic Setup** or press <kbd>1</kbd>. Basic Setup does not support OAuth connections for ingestion from Google Drive, OneDrive, or AWS.
   The TUI prompts you for the required startup values.
   Click **Generate Passwords** to autocomplete fields that contain **Auto-generated Secure Password**, or bring your own passwords.
    <details open>
    <summary>Where do I find the required startup values?</summary>
    
    | Variable | Where to Find | Description |
    |----------|---------------|-------------|

    | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | API key from your OpenAI account. |
    | `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER` | User generated | Username for Langflow admin access. For more, see [Langflow docs](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-superuser). |
    | `LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` | Auto-generated secure password | Password for Langflow admin access. For more, see the [Langflow docs](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#langflow-superuser). |

    </details>
   
   To complete credentials, click **Save Configuration**.

6. To start OpenRAG with your credentials, click **Start Container Services**.
   Startup pulls container images and starts them, so it can take some time.
   The operation has completed when the **Close** button is available and the terminal displays:
   ```bash
   Services started successfully
   Command completed successfully
   ```

7. To open the OpenRAG application, click **Open App** or press <kbd>6</kbd>.
