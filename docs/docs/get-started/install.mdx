OpenRAG can be installed in multiple ways:

* [**Docker**](#install-and-run-docker): Deploy the full OpenRAG stack with Docker Compose, including all services and dependencies.

* [**TUI**](tui.mdx): Use the Terminal User Interface to install, run, and configure your OpenRAG deployment without running Docker commands.

## Docker {#install-and-run-docker}

The OpenRAG Docker compose file starts five containers:

| Container Name | Default Address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| OpenRAG Backend | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI server and core functionality. |
| OpenRAG Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | React web interface for users. |
| Langflow | http://localhost:7860 | AI workflow engine and flow management. |
| OpenSearch | http://localhost:9200 | Vector database for document storage. |
| OpenSearch Dashboards | http://localhost:5601 | Database administration interface. |

There are two different Docker Compose files.
They deploy the same applications and containers, but to different environments.

- [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) is an OpenRAG deployment with GPU support for accelerated AI processing.

- [`docker-compose-cpu.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose-cpu.yml) is a CPU-only version of OpenRAG for systems without GPU support. Use this Docker compose file for environments where GPU drivers aren't available.

Before installing OpenRAG with Docker, ensure you have:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- For GPU support: (TBD)

1. Clone the OpenRAG repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag.git
   cd openrag
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the repository root.
    ```
    touch .env
    ```

3. Set environment variables. The Docker Compose files are populated with values from your `.env`, so the following values are **required** to be set:

   ```bash
   OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER=admin
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your_langflow_password
   LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```
   For more information on configuring OpenRAG with environment variables, see [Environment variables](configure/environment-variables).
   For additional configuration values, including `config.yaml`, see [Configuration](/configure/configuration).

4. Deploy OpenRAG with Docker Compose based on your deployment type.

   For GPU-enabled systems, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   For CPU-only systems, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yml up -d
   ```

5. Verify installation by confirming all services are running.

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

   You can now access the application at:

   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
   - **Langflow**: http://localhost:7860

## Python wheel {#install-and-run-the-openrag-oss-python-wheel}

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies and infrastructure:

    - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
       - macOS and Linux: Version 3.10 to 3.13
       - Windows: Version 3.10 to 3.12
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    - Sufficient infrastructure:
       - Minimum: Dual-core CPU and 2 GB RAM
       - Recommended: Multi-core CPU and at least 4 GB RAM

2. Create a virtual environment with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments).

    <summary>Need help with virtual environments?</summary>

    Virtual environments ensure OpenRAG is installed in an isolated, fresh environment.
    To create a new virtual environment, do the following.

        <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="linux-macos" label="Linux or macOS" default>

        1. Navigate to where you want your virtual environment to be created, and then create it with `uv`:

            ```shell
            uv venv VENV_NAME
            ```

            Replace `VENV_NAME` with a name for your virtual environment.

        2. Start the virtual environment:

            ```shell
            source VENV_NAME/bin/activate
            ```

            Your shell's prompt changes to display that you're currently working in a virtual environment:

            ```text
            (VENV_NAME) ➜  openrag git:(main) ✗
            ```

        3. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your regular shell, type `deactivate`.

            When activated, the virtual environment temporarily modifies your `PATH` variable to prioritize packages installed within the virtual environment.
            To avoid conflicts with other projects, it's a good idea to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done working in it.

            To delete the virtual environment, type `rm -rf VENV_NAME`.
            This completely removes the virtual environment directory and its contents.

        </TabItem>
        </Tabs>
    </details>

3. Install the wheel from PyPI.
   
   ```bash
   uv pip install openrag-*.whl
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   
   ```bash
   openrag --version
   ```
   
   This should display the installed version of OpenRAG.
