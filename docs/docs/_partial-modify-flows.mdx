All flows included with OpenRAG are designed to be modular, performant, and provider-agnostic.
To modify a flow, click <Icon name="Settings2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Settings**, and click **Edit in Langflow**.
OpenRAG's visual editor is based on the [Langflow visual editor](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-overview), so you can edit your flows to match your specific use case.
