There are two different Docker Compose files.
They deploy the same applications and containers, but to different environments.

- [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) is an OpenRAG deployment with GPU support for accelerated AI processing.

- [`docker-compose-cpu.yml`](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/blob/main/docker-compose-cpu.yml) is a CPU-only version of OpenRAG for systems without GPU support. Use this Docker compose file for environments where GPU drivers aren't available.

To install OpenRAG with Docker Compose:

1. Clone the OpenRAG repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag.git
   cd openrag
   ```

2. Copy the example `.env` file that is included in the repository root.
  The example file includes all environment variables with comments to guide you in finding and setting their values.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Alternatively, create a new `.env` file in the repository root.
   ```
   touch .env
   ```

3. Set environment variables. The Docker Compose files are populated with values from your `.env`, so the following values are **required** to be set:

   ```bash
   OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER=admin
   LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your_langflow_password
   LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```
   For more information on configuring OpenRAG with environment variables, see [Environment variables](/reference/configuration).
   For additional configuration values, including `config.yaml`, see [Configuration](/reference/configuration).

4. Deploy OpenRAG with Docker Compose based on your deployment type.

   For GPU-enabled systems, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   For CPU-only systems, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yml up -d
   ```

   The OpenRAG Docker Compose file starts five containers:
   | Container Name | Default Address | Purpose |
   |---|---|---|
   | OpenRAG Backend | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI server and core functionality. |
   | OpenRAG Frontend | http://localhost:3000 | React web interface for users. |
   | Langflow | http://localhost:7860 | AI workflow engine and flow management. |
   | OpenSearch | http://localhost:9200 | Vector database for document storage. |
   | OpenSearch Dashboards | http://localhost:5601 | Database administration interface. |

5. Verify installation by confirming all services are running.

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

   You can now access the application at:

   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
   - **Langflow**: http://localhost:7860

6. To use the OpenRAG application and continue with application onboarding, access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Rebuild all Docker containers

If you need to reset state and rebuild all of your containers, run the following command.
Your OpenSearch and Langflow databases will be lost.
Documents stored in the `./documents` directory will persist, since the directory is mounted as a volume in the OpenRAG backend container.

```bash
docker compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
```
