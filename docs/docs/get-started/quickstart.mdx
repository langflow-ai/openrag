Get started with OpenRAG by loading your knowledge, swapping out your language model, and then chatting with the OpenRAG API.

## Prerequisites

- Install and start OpenRAG

## Find your way around 

1. In OpenRAG, click <Icon name="MessageSquare" aria-hidden="true"/> **Chat**.
2. Ask `What documents are available to you?`
   The agent responds with a message summarizing the documents that OpenRAG loads by default, which are PDFs about evaluating data quality when using LLMs in health care.
3. To confirm the agent is correct, click <Icon name="Library" aria-hidden="true"/> **Knowledge**.
   The **Knowledge** page lists the documents OpenRAG has ingested into the OpenSearch vector database. Click on a document to display the chunks derived from splitting the default documents into the vector database.

## Add your own knowledge

1. To add documents to your knowledge base, click <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> **Add Knowledge**.
   * Select **Add File** to add a single file from your local machine (mapped with the Docker volume mount).
   * Select **Process Folder** to process an entire folder of documents from your local machine (mapped with the Docker volume mount).
2. Return to the Chat window and ask a question about your loaded data.
   For example, with a manual about a PC tablet loaded, ask `How do I connect this device to WiFI?`
   The agent responds with a message indicating it now has your knowledge as context for answering questions.
3. Click the <Icon name="Gear" aria-hidden="true"/> **Function Call: search_documents (tool_call)** that is printed in the Playground.
These events log the agent's request to the tool and the tool's response, so you have direct visibility into your agent's functionality.
If you aren't getting the results you need, you can further tune the knowledge ingestion and agent behavior in the next section.

## Swap out the language model to modify agent behavior

To modify the knowledge ingestion or Agent behavior, click <Icon name="Settings" aria-hidden="true"/> **Settings**.

In this example, you'll try a different LLM to demonstrate how the Agent's response changes.

1. To edit the Agent's behavior, click **Edit in Langflow**.
2. OpenRAG warns you that you're entering Langflow. Click **Proceed**.
3. The OpenRAG Open Search Agent flow appears.

4. In the **Language Model** component, under **Model Provider**, select **Anthropic**.
   :::note
   This guide uses an Anthropic model for demonstration purposes. If you want to use a different provider, change the **Model Provider** and **Model Name** fields, and then provide credentials for your selected provider.
   :::
5. Save your flow with <kbd>Command+S</kbd>.
6. In OpenRAG, start a new conversation by clicking the <Icon name="Plus" aria-hidden="true"/> in the **Conversations** tab.
7. Ask the same question as before to demonstrate how a different language model changes the results.
