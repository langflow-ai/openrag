OpenRAG uses [Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/) for its document ingestion pipeline.
More specifically, OpenRAG uses [Docling Serve](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve), which starts a `docling-serve` process on your local machine and runs Docling ingestion through an API service.

OpenRAG chose Docling for its support for a wide variety of file formats, high performance, and advanced understanding of tables and images.

## Docling ingestion settings

These settings control the Docling ingestion parameters.

OpenRAG will warn you if `docling-serve` is not running.
To start or stop `docling-serve` or any other native services, in the TUI main menu, click **Start Native Services** or **Stop Native Services**.

## Use OpenRAG default ingestion instead of Docling
