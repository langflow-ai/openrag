All flows included with OpenRAG are designed to be modular, performant, and provider-agnostic.
To modify a flow, click <Icon name="Settings2" aria-hidden="true"/> **Settings**, and click **Edit in Langflow**.
Flows are edited in the same way as in the [Langflow visual editor](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-overview).
