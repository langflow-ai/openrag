The OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI) allows you to set up, configure, and monitor your OpenRAG deployment directly from the terminal, on any operating system.

Instead of starting OpenRAG using Docker commands and manually editing values in the `.env` file, the TUI walks you through the setup. It prompts for variables where required, creates a `.env` file for you, and then starts OpenRAG.

Once OpenRAG is running, use the TUI to monitor your application, control your containers, and retrieve logs.

## Start the TUI

To start the TUI, run the following commands from the directory where you installed OpenRAG.

```bash
uv sync
uv run openrag
```

The TUI Welcome Screen offers basic and advanced setup options.
For more information on setup values during installation, see [Install OpenRAG](/install).

## Navigation

The TUI accepts mouse input or keyboard commands.

- <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd>: move between options
- <kbd>Tab</kbd>/<kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>: switch fields and buttons
- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: select/confirm
- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: back
- <kbd>Q</kbd>: quit
- <kbd>Number keys (1-4)</kbd>: quick access to main screens

## Container management

The TUI can deploy, manage, and upgrade your OpenRAG containers.

### Start container services

Click **Start Container Services** to start the OpenRAG containers.
The TUI automatically detects your container runtime, and then checks if your machine has compatible GPU support by checking for `CUDA`, `NVIDIA_SMI`, and Docker/Podman runtime support. This check determines which Docker Compose file OpenRAG uses.
The TUI then pulls the images and deploys the containers with the following command.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
If images are missing, the TUI runs `docker compose pull`, then runs `docker compose up -d`.

### Start native services

A "native" service in OpenRAG refers to a service run natively on your machine, and not within a container.
The `docling serve` process is a native service in OpenRAG, because it's a document processing service that is run on your local machine, and controlled separately from the containers.

To start or stop `docling serve` or any other native services, in the TUI main menu, click **Start Native Services** or **Stop Native Services**.

To view the status, port, or PID of a native service, in the TUI main menu, click [Status](#status).

### Status

The **Status** menu displays information on your container deployment.
Here you can check container health, find your service ports, view logs, and upgrade your containers.

To view streaming logs, select the container you want to view, and press <kbd>l</kbd>.
To copy your logs, click **Copy to Clipboard**.

To **upgrade** your containers, click **Upgrade**.
**Upgrade** runs `docker compose pull` and then `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.
The first command pulls the latest images of OpenRAG.
The second command recreates the containers with your data persisted.

To **reset** your containers, click **Reset**.
Reset gives you a completely fresh start.
Reset deletes all of your data, including OpenSearch data, uploaded documents, and authentication.
**Reset** runs two commands.
It first stops and removes all containers, volumes, and local images.
```
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans --rmi local
```

When the first command is complete, OpenRAG removes any additional Docker objects with `prune`.

```
docker system prune -f
```

## Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** menu provides health monitoring for your container runtimes and monitoring of your OpenSearch security.
